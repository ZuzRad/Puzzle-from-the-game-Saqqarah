## 📝 General Information
"Puzzle from the game Saqqarah" is a 2D puzzle game inspired by the game "Saqqarah: The Pyramid of Puzzles". The main objective of the game is to navigate a graph consisting of vertices and connections, where the player must create a path that covers all connections without repeating any.

The puzzle is set on a board that represents a graph with nodes (vertices) and edges (connections). The player starts by selecting an initial vertex and then moves to a connected vertex, creating a path as they progress. The goal is to cover all the edges without retracing any steps. However, vertices can be visited multiple times, allowing for flexible path planning. If the player reaches a point where no further moves are possible and the puzzle is not solved, they can restart and try a different approach.
